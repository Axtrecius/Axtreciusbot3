# Hex-Cogs
Cogs made by me for Red - Discord Bot by Twentysix26 as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge I'm taking.
### Now available on the [Cogs.Red cogs website](https://cogs.red/cogs/Hexexpeck/Hex-Cogs/)

## How to install
Use Red's downloader cog to install. Do the following:

First, use the `[p]cog repo add` command:
```
[p]cog repo add Hex-Cogs https://github.com/Hexexpeck/Hex-Cogs
```
Replacing `[p]` with your bot's prefix.

Then use the `[p]cog install` command to install a cog.
```
[p]cog install Hex-Cogs <cog name here>
```
Replacing `[p]` with your bot's prefix. And replacing the `cog name here` with the cog you want to install.

And you're done!
